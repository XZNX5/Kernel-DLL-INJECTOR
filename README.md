# Introduction
The Kernelmode Manual Mapping DLL Injector is a powerful tool designed to inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into the memory space of a target process running in kernel mode. This tool provides a mechanism for loading a DLL into a target process without relying on traditional APIs, offering greater stealth and bypassing certain security measures. It should be noted that the usage of such tools may be restricted or prohibited by law or terms of service, and it is essential to use this tool responsibly and only on systems you have proper authorization to access.

# Features
 ###### Socket Communication:
 The Injector employs Socket-based communication to interact with the target process, allowing for efficient data exchange and control.

###### Manual Mapping:
The Injector leverages the manual mapping technique to load DLLs into the memory space of the target process, bypassing traditional loading methods that could be detected by security systems.

###### Threadless Injection:
The Injector avoids using additional threads during the DLL injection process, minimizing the risk of detection and improving the injection's stealth.
